# ArduPilot for apm2 boards

## AntennaTracker ##

Official AntennaTracker's sources for apm2 ([branch master-AVR](https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/tree/master-AVR)) are stopped at version 0.7.4 (without support for yaw continuous rotation servos). New AntennaTracker release from official sources ([branch AntennaTracker-release](https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/tree/AntennaTracker-release/AntennaTracker) is at version 1.0.0 but does not compile for apm2). With this MOD AntennaTracker is update at v1.0.0 (yaw continuous rotation servos are now supported).
